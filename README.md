# IDS-Snort-Network-Monitoring

## Objective

Implement network monitoring using IDS and Snort to detect and analyze network threats, enhancing security through continuous monitoring and rapid response.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in configuring and deploying Snort.
- Analyze network traffic to identify potential security threats.
- Troubleshooting and resolving configuration issues.
- Interpreting Snort alerts and logs for incident response.
- Improving security posture through monitoring and response.

### Tools Used

- Ubuntu: Linux distrobution
- Snort: An open-source intrusion detection system used for network traffic analysis and threat detection.

## Steps

1. Fire up the Ubuntu machine, open a terminal, and run update/upgrade before installing prerequisite packages.
2. Make a directory for Snort and intall prequisites and dependencies for Snort.
3. After Snort is installed create some rules for analysis. Using ICMP rules, create a local rules file to allow alerts. These tell Snort to send an alert on ICMP traffic.<br>
